\chapter{Summary}
 Documenting work in the laboratory of Dr. Jussi Eloranta, a professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Chemistry at California State University, Northridge. Dr. Eloranta specializes in the empirical and computational analysis of the quantum behavior of helium that has been cooled very near to absolute zero. This work deals with computational mathematics applied to problems in modern quantum chemistry, including the diagonalization of large matrices.
